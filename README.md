# Portfolio Website

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a professional showcase of my front-end development skills and highlight my expertise in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It serves as a platform to demonstrate my passion for web development and provide potential clients and collaborators with a comprehensive overview of my capabilities and previous work. The portfolio website aims to deliver an engaging and user-friendly experience, presenting my projects and achievements in an organized and visually appealing manner.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Deployment Environment

The portfolio website was created using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It can be deployed to any hosting environment that supports static websites. Some popular options include Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any web server capable of serving static files.

## CI/CD

For this project, I currently do not have CI/CD implemented. However, I plan to explore and implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices in the future to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.

Some common CI/CD tools and services that I may consider using include Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD. These tools can help streamline the development workflow, enable automated testing, and facilitate smooth and efficient deployment of the portfolio website.

If you wish to set up CI/CD for this project, you can explore these tools/services and configure them according to your specific requirements and preferences.

## Deployed on Vercel
